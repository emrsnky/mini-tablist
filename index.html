            London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest
            of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two
            millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest
            metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and
            cultural centre. Big Ben Big Ben Big Ben, London. London is situated
            in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50
            miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. In
            satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit compactly in
            a Green Belt of open land, with its principal ring highway (the M25
            motorway) threaded around it at a radius of about 20 miles (30 km)
            from the city centre. The growth of the built-up area was halted by
            strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s. Its physical limits
            more or less correspond to the administrative and statistical
            boundaries separating the metropolitan county of Greater London from
            the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in clockwise
            order) to the south of the river and Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire,
            and Essex to the north. The historic counties of Kent,
            Hertfordshire, and Essex extend in area beyond the current
            administrative counties with the same names to include substantial
            parts of the metropolitan county of Greater London, which was formed
            in 1965. Most of Greater London south of the Thames belongs to the
            historic county of Surrey, while most of Greater London north of the
            Thames belongs historically to the county of Middlesex. Area Greater
            London, 607 square miles (1,572 square km). Pop. (2001) Greater

            Paris, city and capital of France, situated in the north-central
            part of the country. People were living on the site of the
            present-day city, located along the Seine River some 233 miles (375
            km) upstream from the river’s mouth on the English Channel (La
            Manche), by about 7600 BCE. The modern city has spread from the
            island (the Île de la Cité) and far beyond both banks of the Seine.
            Paris Paris Paris occupies a central position in the rich
            agricultural region known as the Paris Basin, and it constitutes one
            of eight départements of the Île-de-France administrative region. It
            is by far the country’s most important centre of commerce and
            culture. Area city, 41 square miles (105 square km); metropolitan
            area, 890 square miles (2,300 square km). Pop. (2020 est.) city,
            2,145,906; (2020 est.) urban agglomeration, 10,858,874. Character of
            the city For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most
            important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the
            opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for
            culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture,
            painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an
            enviable reputation. Its sobriquet “the City of Light” (“la Ville
            Lumière”), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for
            Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and
            intellectual pursuits. Paris’s site at a crossroads of both water
            and land routes significant not only to France but also to Europe
            has had a continuing influence on its growth. Under Roman
            administration, in the 1st century BCE, the original site on the Île
            de la Cité was designated the capital of the Parisii tribe and
            territory. The Frankish king Clovis I had taken Paris from the Gauls
            by 494 CE and later made his capital there. Under Hugh Capet (ruled
            987–996) and the Capetian dynasty the preeminence of Paris was
            firmly established, and Paris became the political and cultural hub
            as modern France took shape. France has long been a highly
            centralized country, and Paris has come to be identified with a
            powerful central state, drawing to itself much of the talent and
            vitality of the provinces.

            Tokyo, city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan. It is
            located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central
            Honshu. It is the focus of the vast metropolitan area often called
            Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in
            Japan.The site of Tokyo has been inhabited since ancient times; the
            small fishing village of Edo existed there for centuries. Edo’s
            development into a city did not occur until the Tokugawa period
            (1603–1867), when it became the capital of the Tokugawa shogunate.
            During this period, however, the imperial family remained in Kyōto,
            the ancient imperial capital. With the Meiji Restoration of 1868,
            which ended the shogunate, the capital was moved to Edo. The city
            was renamed Tokyo, meaning “eastern capital.” Edo had been Japan’s
            largest city since the 17th century. Tokyo’s population exceeded one
            million in the late 19th century, and as Japan’s political,
            economic, and cultural centre it became one of the world’s most
            populous cities in the 20th century. The city is built on low,
            alluvial plains and adjacent upland hills. The climate is mild in
            winter and hot and humid in the summer. Early summer and early
            autumn are rainy seasons; two or three typhoons usually occur during
            September and October. The metropolitan area is the largest
            industrial, commercial, and financial centre in Japan. Many domestic
            and international financial institutions and other businesses are
            headquartered in central Tokyo. The city is an important wholesale
            centre, where goods from all parts of the country and the world are
            distributed. Tokyo is part of the Keihin Industrial Zone, centred on
            the western shore of the bay, which has become the country’s leading
            manufacturing region. Light and labour-intensive industries
            predominate in the city, notably printing and publishing and the
            manufacture of electronic equipment.
